## Proposed Infrastructure Architecture

![design](design.jpg "Architecture")

* AWS Fargate
* AWS Application Load Balancer

The application load balancer should have an `/service` endpoint and `/__healthcheck__` health check endpoint.

If something is missing, feel free adding it to a solution.

## Objectives

The task objectives were as follows:

* Create infrastructure-as-code as per proposed Architecture
* `Makefile` has all the commands requred to run/test
* Explain how to run in `README.md`

Optional

* Test Infrastructure: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest

## Deploy

* Install Terraform v0.11.15-oci
* Install golang for terratest
* Update terraform/aws/locals.tf and terraform/aws/container_definitions.json related your service
* Execute make deploy

## Test the whole setup

* Execute make test


## Note

Not make pull requests. Fork/Clone the repo instead and work on it. Master branches only.

There is no need to deploy infrastructure to AWS. Just make sure it fully valid terraform infrastructure-as-code setup.
